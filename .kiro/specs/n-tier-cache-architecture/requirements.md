# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current fixed two-tier cache architecture (HotStore + ColdStore) into a flexible N-tier cache system using a slice of Store interfaces. This architectural change will enable users to configure any number of cache tiers (e.g., L1 memory, L2 file system, L3 cloud storage) while simplifying the core cache logic and eliminating the need for nullStore patterns.

The change represents a significant architectural improvement that enhances flexibility, maintainability, and scalability while maintaining the existing stream-based performance characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want to configure multiple cache tiers beyond the current two-tier limitation, so that I can create sophisticated caching strategies that match my specific performance and cost requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure a cache with multiple stores THEN the system SHALL support any number of cache tiers (not limited to 2)
2. WHEN I configure stores in order THEN the system SHALL treat stores[0] as the fastest tier and subsequent stores as progressively slower tiers
3. WHEN I configure a single store THEN the system SHALL work without requiring a nullStore implementation
4. IF I configure stores with different characteristics THEN the system SHALL handle each store according to its interface contract

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want cache lookups to check tiers sequentially from fastest to slowest, so that I get the best possible performance while maintaining data availability across all tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request data with Get() THEN the system SHALL check stores[0] first, then stores[1], and so on until a hit is found
2. WHEN data is found in stores[i] where i > 0 THEN the system SHALL promote the data to all preceding tiers (stores[0] through stores[i-1])
3. WHEN promotion occurs THEN the system SHALL use streaming operations to avoid memory overhead
4. WHEN no data is found in any tier THEN the system SHALL fetch from origin as before
5. IF a store operation fails THEN the system SHALL continue checking remaining stores rather than failing immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want data promotion between tiers to be efficient and non-blocking, so that cache performance remains optimal even during tier reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is promoted from a lower tier THEN the system SHALL use io.TeeReader to stream data simultaneously to the client and upper tiers
2. WHEN promotion occurs THEN the system SHALL not block the client response
3. WHEN multiple promotions happen concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data corruption
4. IF promotion to an upper tier fails THEN the system SHALL still serve the data to the client successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want write operations to target the primary tier consistently, so that fresh data is always placed in the fastest available storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use Set() operations THEN the system SHALL write to stores[0] (the primary/fastest tier)
2. WHEN background refresh occurs THEN the system SHALL write refreshed data to stores[0]
3. WHEN negative caching occurs THEN the system SHALL write negative entries to stores[0]
4. IF stores[0] is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error rather than falling back to other tiers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want delete operations to remove data from all tiers consistently, so that deleted data doesn't resurface from lower tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I delete a cache entry THEN the system SHALL attempt deletion from all configured stores
2. WHEN deletion fails in some tiers THEN the system SHALL continue attempting deletion in remaining tiers
3. WHEN deletion completes THEN the system SHALL log any partial failures but not treat them as operation failures
4. IF all deletions fail THEN the system SHALL return the first encountered error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cache developer, I want the new architecture to maintain backward compatibility during transition, so that existing code continues to work while migration occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing WithHotStore() and WithColdStore() options are used THEN the system SHALL internally convert them to a stores slice
2. WHEN both old and new configuration options are used THEN the system SHALL return a clear configuration error
3. WHEN migrating from v1 to v2 THEN existing functionality SHALL behave identically
4. IF only WithHotStore() is configured THEN the system SHALL create a single-tier cache without nullStore

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cache developer, I want simplified core logic that is easier to understand and maintain, so that the codebase remains manageable as features are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Get() method THEN the system SHALL use a simple loop structure instead of separate hot/cold/miss logic paths
2. WHEN handling cache hits THEN the system SHALL use consistent promotion logic regardless of which tier contains the data
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL not require special handling for different tier combinations
4. IF debugging cache behavior THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging for which tier served the data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cache user, I want flexible configuration options for N-tier setups, so that I can easily specify complex caching hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring multiple tiers THEN the system SHALL provide a WithStores(stores ...Store) option
2. WHEN using WithStores() THEN the system SHALL validate that at least one store is provided
3. WHEN stores are configured THEN the system SHALL preserve the order specified by the user
4. IF invalid store configurations are provided THEN the system SHALL return descriptive validation errors
