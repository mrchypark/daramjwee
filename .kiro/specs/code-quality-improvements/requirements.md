# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical code quality issues identified in the daramjwee codebase analysis. The primary focus is on resolving linting warnings, improving code maintainability, and ensuring adherence to Go best practices. These improvements will enhance code readability, reduce technical debt, and prepare the codebase for production use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the daramjwee codebase, I want all linting warnings to be resolved so that the code adheres to Go best practices and maintains high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running go vet or golangci-lint THEN the system SHALL return zero warnings for unused parameters
2. WHEN reviewing null eviction policy methods THEN the system SHALL use underscore naming for intentionally unused parameters
3. WHEN examining mock store methods THEN the system SHALL properly handle or rename unused context parameters
4. WHEN checking all exported functions and types THEN the system SHALL have appropriate documentation comments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the daramjwee library, I want all exported constants, variables, and types to have proper documentation so that I can understand their purpose and usage without reading the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining exported constants THEN the system SHALL have documentation comments explaining their purpose
2. WHEN reviewing exported variables THEN the system SHALL have comments describing when and why they are used
3. WHEN looking at exported error variables THEN the system SHALL have clear descriptions of the conditions that trigger them
4. WHEN checking compression types THEN the system SHALL have comments explaining each algorithm's characteristics
5. WHEN reviewing public interfaces THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive godoc comments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the daramjwee API, I want consistent and clear naming conventions so that the code is intuitive and follows Go idioms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the main cache implementation THEN the system SHALL have a non-stuttering type name
2. WHEN importing the daramjwee package THEN the system SHALL not have redundant package prefixes in type names
3. WHEN examining struct and interface names THEN the system SHALL follow Go naming conventions
4. WHEN reviewing method signatures THEN the system SHALL have consistent parameter naming patterns
5. WHEN checking for naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL avoid package name repetition in type names
