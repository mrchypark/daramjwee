# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the performance degradation observed in the buffer pool optimization for large data transfers (256KB+). Current benchmarks show that buffer pool operations for 256KB data are 7.9x slower than without buffer pool, indicating a significant performance regression that needs to be resolved. The goal is to optimize buffer pool behavior for large data while maintaining the performance benefits for medium-sized data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using daramjwee with large objects (256KB+), I want buffer pool operations to provide performance benefits rather than degradation so that my application maintains optimal throughput for all data sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing 256KB objects with buffer pool enabled THEN the system SHALL perform at least as fast as without buffer pool
2. WHEN processing 512KB objects with buffer pool enabled THEN the system SHALL show measurable performance improvement over standard operations
3. WHEN processing 1MB+ objects with buffer pool enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance without memory pressure
4. WHEN buffer pool handles large objects THEN the system SHALL not cause excessive memory allocation or GC pressure
5. WHEN large object processing completes THEN the system SHALL properly return buffers to appropriate pools without memory leaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring daramjwee performance, I want buffer pool to automatically adapt its strategy based on object size so that optimal performance is achieved across different workload patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buffer pool encounters objects larger than configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL use alternative optimization strategies
2. WHEN processing mixed object sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain optimal performance for each size category
3. WHEN large objects exceed buffer pool limits THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard operations
4. WHEN buffer pool strategy changes THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information for monitoring
5. WHEN adaptive strategies are used THEN the system SHALL maintain thread safety and concurrent access patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer configuring buffer pool settings, I want granular control over large object handling so that I can optimize performance for my specific workload characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring buffer pool THEN the system SHALL provide options for large object handling strategies
2. WHEN setting large object thresholds THEN the system SHALL validate configuration parameters for consistency
3. WHEN enabling large object optimizations THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation about trade-offs and recommendations
4. WHEN large object settings are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages with guidance
5. WHEN buffer pool configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply new settings without requiring cache restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer analyzing buffer pool behavior, I want detailed metrics about large object handling so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buffer pool processes large objects THEN the system SHALL track separate metrics for different size categories
2. WHEN monitoring buffer pool performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics about strategy selection and effectiveness
3. WHEN analyzing memory usage THEN the system SHALL report buffer allocation patterns for different object sizes
4. WHEN reviewing performance data THEN the system SHALL include timing metrics for large object operations
5. WHEN buffer pool statistics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing streaming operations with large data, I want buffer pool to optimize memory usage patterns so that large transfers don't cause memory pressure or performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming large objects THEN the system SHALL use appropriately sized buffers to minimize memory overhead
2. WHEN processing multiple large objects concurrently THEN the system SHALL manage buffer allocation to prevent memory exhaustion
3. WHEN large object streaming completes THEN the system SHALL efficiently reclaim and reuse buffer resources
4. WHEN memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL adapt buffer allocation strategies to maintain stability
5. WHEN streaming very large objects THEN the system SHALL use chunked processing to maintain consistent memory usage
