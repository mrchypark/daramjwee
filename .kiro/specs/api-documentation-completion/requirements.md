# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on completing comprehensive documentation for all public APIs in the daramjwee caching library. The goal is to provide clear, comprehensive, and useful documentation that enables developers to effectively use the library without needing to read the source code. This includes adding missing godoc comments, improving existing documentation, and ensuring consistency across all public interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating daramjwee into my application, I want comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces so that I can understand how to use each component effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Cache interface THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation for each method including parameters, return values, and usage examples
2. WHEN examining the Store interface THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation explaining the storage contract and implementation requirements
3. WHEN looking at the Fetcher interface THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation about the fetching contract and error handling
4. WHEN checking the EvictionPolicy interface THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about policy behavior and thread safety requirements
5. WHEN reviewing the BufferPool interface THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about buffer management and performance implications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer configuring daramjwee, I want detailed documentation for all configuration options so that I can optimize the cache for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Option functions THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation explaining each configuration parameter and its impact
2. WHEN reviewing Config struct THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive field documentation with recommended values and constraints
3. WHEN looking at BufferPoolConfig THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about buffer pool tuning parameters
4. WHEN checking timeout and worker configuration options THEN the system SHALL have clear guidance on appropriate values for different scenarios
5. WHEN reviewing eviction and caching policies THEN the system SHALL have documentation explaining trade-offs and use cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer handling errors from daramjwee, I want comprehensive error documentation so that I can implement proper error handling and recovery strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering error variables THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation explaining when each error occurs and how to handle it
2. WHEN reviewing error types THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about error conditions and recovery strategies
3. WHEN examining ConfigError THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation about configuration validation failures
4. WHEN looking at compression errors THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about compression failure scenarios
5. WHEN checking cache operation errors THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about error conditions and appropriate responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with different storage backends, I want detailed documentation for each store implementation so that I can choose and configure the appropriate storage solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing MemStore documentation THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive information about memory usage, eviction behavior, and performance characteristics
2. WHEN examining FileStore documentation THEN the system SHALL have detailed information about file system requirements, atomic operations, and configuration options
3. WHEN looking at objstore adapter documentation THEN the system SHALL have clear information about cloud storage integration and configuration requirements
4. WHEN checking store configuration options THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about capacity limits, locking strategies, and performance tuning
5. WHEN reviewing store-specific features THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about hashed keys, copy strategies, and compatibility considerations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing custom components, I want comprehensive documentation about extension points so that I can create custom stores, policies, and compressors that integrate properly with daramjwee.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a custom Store THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about interface requirements, thread safety expectations, and integration patterns
2. WHEN creating a custom EvictionPolicy THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about policy contract, performance considerations, and thread safety requirements
3. WHEN developing a custom Compressor THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation about compression interface requirements and error handling expectations
4. WHEN implementing custom Fetcher logic THEN the system SHALL have detailed documentation about fetching contract, metadata handling, and error scenarios
5. WHEN extending the library THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive documentation about best practices, common patterns, and integration guidelines
