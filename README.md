# daramjwee üêøÔ∏è `/d…ëÀêr…ëÀêmd íwiÀê/`

A pragmatic and lightweight hybrid caching middleware for Go.

`daramjwee` sits between your application and your origin data source (e.g., a database or an API), providing an efficient, stream-based hybrid caching layer. It is designed with a focus on simplicity and core functionality to achieve high throughput at a low cost in cloud-native environments.

## Core Design Philosophy

`daramjwee` is built on two primary principles:

1.  **Purely Stream-Based API:** All data is processed through `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces. This means that even large objects are handled without memory overhead from intermediate buffering, guaranteeing optimal performance for proxying use cases.

2.  **Modular and Pluggable Architecture:** Key components such as the storage backend (`Store`), eviction strategy (`EvictionPolicy`), and asynchronous task runner (`Worker`) are all designed as interfaces. This allows users to easily swap in their own implementations to fit specific needs.

## Key Features

* üêøÔ∏è **Hybrid Cache Tiers:** Combines a fast local store (Hot Tier) with a large-capacity remote store (Cold Tier) to optimize for both performance and cost. The Cold Tier is optional; if not configured, a `nullStore` is used to reduce code complexity.

* üî• **Flexible Storage Backends:** Comes with built-in support for in-memory (`MemStore`) and filesystem (`FileStore`) backends.

* ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Native:** An adapter for `thanos-io/objstore` provides out-of-the-box support for major cloud object stores like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to be used as a Cold Tier.

* üîÑ **Background Refresh & Promotion:** On a cache hit, it serves the user request immediately while asynchronously refreshing the cache in the background via a worker (`ScheduleRefresh`). Data hit in the Cold Tier is automatically promoted to the Hot Tier.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **ETag-based Efficiency:** Exchanges ETags with the origin server to check for content changes. If the content is not modified (`ErrNotModified`), it avoids unnecessary data transfer, saving network bandwidth.

* üß© **Pluggable Eviction Policies:** Includes LRU (Least Recently Used) and S2-FIFO policies by default. Users can apply custom strategies by implementing the `EvictionPolicy` interface.

## How It Works

The data retrieval flow in `daramjwee` is as follows:

1.  **Check Hot Tier:** Looks for the object in the Hot Tier.
    * **Hit:** Immediately returns the object stream and schedules a background task to refresh the cache.
2.  **Check Cold Tier:** If not in the Hot Tier, it checks the Cold Tier.
    * **Hit:** Streams the object to the client while simultaneously promoting it to the Hot Tier.
3.  **Fetch from Origin:** If the object is in neither tier (Cache Miss), it invokes the user-provided `Fetcher` to retrieve the data from the origin.
    * The fetched data stream is sent to the client and written to the Hot Tier at the same time.
    * A background job can be scheduled to also write the data to the Cold Tier.

## Getting Started

Here is a simple example of using `daramjwee` in a web server.

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/go-kit/log"
	"github.com/go-kit/log/level"
	"github.com/mrchypark/daramjwee"
	"github.com/mrchypark/daramjwee/pkg/store/filestore"
)

// 1. Define how to fetch data from your origin.
type originFetcher struct {
	key string
}

func (f *originFetcher) Fetch(ctx context.Context, oldETag string) (*daramjwee.FetchResult, error) {
	fmt.Printf("[Origin] Fetching key: %s\n", f.key)
	// In a real application, this would be a DB query or an API call.
	const originData = "Hello, Daramjwee!"
	const originETag = "v1"

	// If the ETag matches, notify that the content has not been modified.
	if oldETag == originETag {
		return nil, daramjwee.ErrNotModified
	}

	return &daramjwee.FetchResult{
		Body:     io.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader([]byte(originData))),
		Metadata: &daramjwee.Metadata{ETag: originETag},
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	logger := log.NewLogfmtLogger(os.Stderr)
	logger = level.NewFilter(logger, level.AllowDebug())

	// 2. Create a store for the Hot Tier (e.g., FileStore).
	hotStore, err := filestore.New("./daramjwee-cache", log.With(logger, "tier", "hot"))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// 3. Create a daramjwee cache instance with your configuration.
	cache, err := daramjwee.New(
		logger,
		daramjwee.WithHotStore(hotStore),
		daramjwee.WithDefaultTimeout(5*time.Second),
		// Optionally add a ColdStore or custom Worker settings.
		// daramjwee.WithColdStore(coldStore),
		// daramjwee.WithWorker("pool", 20, 100, 1*time.Minute),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer cache.Close()

	// 4. Use the cache in your HTTP handlers.
	http.HandleFunc("/objects/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		key := r.URL.Path[len("/objects/"):]

		// Call cache.Get() to retrieve the data stream.
		stream, err := cache.Get(r.Context(), key, &originFetcher{key: key})
		if err != nil {
			if err == daramjwee.ErrNotFound {
				http.Error(w, "Object Not Found", http.StatusNotFound)
			} else {
				http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			}
			return
		}
		defer stream.Close()

		// Stream the response directly to the client.
		io.Copy(w, stream)
	})

	fmt.Println("Server is running on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
