// In a complete application, this function would typically be responsible for:
// 1. Parsing command-line arguments and configuration files.
// 2. Initializing the cache system (e.g., DaramjweeCache) with appropriate stores (hot, cold) and settings.
// 3. Setting up and starting a server (e.g., HTTP server) to handle cache requests.
// 4. Managing graceful shutdown and cleanup of resources.

	// Future development will replace this with actual application logic.
